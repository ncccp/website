The four person committee that constitutes the Pacific Northern California College of Clinical Pharmacy (NCCCP) successfully hosted the inaugural PharmD Research Day on July 9, 2012. PharmD Research Day, the first of its kind at the School, was organized by Lisa (Xiaowen) Jiang ‘13 and Abigail Kurtz ‘13 “to inspire students to look into research and make them aware of what research has to offer”.

Students and faculty were invited to participate and submit poster presentations that have been in development in the last year and a half. Sixteen posters were presented at the event which represented the hard work of nearly 50 students and eight faculty members. The posters covered research topics such as Medicare Part D, immunizations, Medication Therapy Management (MTM), asthma, smoking cessation, human stem cells, and more.

Many of the posters have been accepted or are in the process of being accepted at national conferences. Kurtz hopes that students also took this opportunity to “enhance their communication skills and practice their presentation for the conferences”.

Participating in academic research is a skill highly recognized inside and outside of academia and gives students hands-on experience and a greater understanding of what they are studying. “Students are not fully aware of the types of research in pharmacy practice versus a research lab and we hope this event will expose them to it,” says Kurtz.

NCCCP is dedicated to educating students about the advancement in the profession, opportunities in residency, and specialized board certifications. NCCCP mirrors American College of Clinical Pharmacy’s (ACCP) commitment to excellence in patient care, research and education, and passion for extending the frontiers of clinical pharmacy.

They would like to give special thanks to first year co-chairs, Elizna Van Zyl ‘14 and Randall Mello ‘14, Dr. William Kehoe ‘96 and Dr. Rajul Patel ‘01, ‘06. This event was sponsored by the Flowers Heritage Foundation.
