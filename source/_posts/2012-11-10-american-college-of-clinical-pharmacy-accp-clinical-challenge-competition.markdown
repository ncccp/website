Each year in the Spring Semester, we hold a competition among 2nd year pharmacy students in teams of 3 to promote our mission of excellence in clinical pharmacy practice. We hold an interest meeting and facilitate the local school-wide competition in order to determine one team to represent Pacific in the national competition. From this point the team competes in a series of online round competitions in a tier-based system.

In our first year competing in 2011, our Pacific team of Jerline, Ryan, and Ian made it to the national competition in New Orleans where they placed 8th in the nation!
