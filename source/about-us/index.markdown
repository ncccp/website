Our committee is dedicated to increasing knowledge and educating the student body about advancement in the profession of pharmacy through opportunities in residency placement and training and specialized board certifications

NCCCP mirrors ACCP’s commitment to excellence in patient care, research, and education, and passion for expanding the frontiers of clinical pharmacy.

Our Goals for 2012-2013

Collect and analyze data pertaining to asthma/COPD disease state and current disease management.
Perform NIOX Inflammation procedure and ACT test on qualified patients
Perform Peak Flow and Pulse Oximetry measurements on qualified patients.
